Programming is so cool that pretty much every celebrity everywhere has tweeted about it. 

### What In the World?
So you're really supposed to believe that everyone loves programming with Flatiron? That can't even be possible, but those images sure prove they did!! So how did we do that? And better yet how can you prank all your friends in just the same way.

Basically, we played with the code that makes up the styling and content of these Twitter pages. We didn't change it on Twitter's servers or change it for *everyone* but we did change it on our browsers, which makes it easy for us to take screenshots. #picsoritdidnthappen

Every single web site in existence is made up of at least two different programming langues - HTML and CSS. HTML, which stands for hypertext markup language, is a language that defines the content of the page. It's a programming way of marking the specific title of your page, images, articles, lists, etc. This is useful for Google to know what search keywords should display our website. CSS, which stands for Cascading Stylesheets, is the language used for styling a website. We use CSS to change font colors and styles, as well as layout and positioning of different items on the page. Without these two languages, websites wouldn't look the way they look or deliver content to us the way they do. Pretty powerful stuff.


###Let's Get Started

* **Step 1:** Download the Chrome browser if you don't already have it.

Chrome has incredibly powerful Developer tools that allow you to see the nuts and bolts of every website. Basically, we can see and locally edit the HTML and CSS.

* **Step 2:** Go to the Twitter page of your favorite celebrity. We'll be using Jimmy Fallon as an example. Once you're on that page, you'll want to hover your mouse of the text of their first tweet, and right click.

* **Step 3:** Select `Inspect Element` from the dropdown options.

This will bring up Chrome's Developer Tools, where we can start to play around with both the actual text on the page, as well as the HTML and CSS of the page.
